<p class="bodytext14"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">the book</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This book is a step-by-step approach to learning
Lingo, the scripting language for Macromedia Director, which is the premier
multimedia authoring tool. You can use Director to create interactive projects
that combine text, sound, graphics, animation, and digital video. Director’s
Lingo scripting language gives you greater control over these multimedia
elements. With Lingo, many developers have created multimedia works for
education, entertainment, and business. These works can be delivered in a
variety of medium for play back on Macintosh,Windows, and several other
platforms. Director movies can be distributed on networks, hard drives, floppy
disks, and CD-ROM. A few representative CD-ROM titles are: Total Distortion,
Iron Helix, The Journeyman Project, Yearn2Learn Peanuts, Rodney Greenblat’s
Dazzeloids, and Macromedia’s Showcase CD. On the World Wide Web there are an
ever growing number of &quot;Shocked&quot; sites that incorporated Director
movies using the freely distributed Director Shockwave Player. Thousands of
these sites are listed in the Shockwave Epicenter at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This book is designed to teach Lingo to people
with no prior scripting background. We assume that you know how to use Director
to create animation and control the Score. Lingo concepts are introduced
gradually with practical examples. Exercises and reviews are used to help build
understanding and retention. Concepts are richly illustrated to promote
visualization and help build understanding.</font></p>
