## Why?

A couple of reasons.

I plan to avoid content lock-in. My google site will disappear when I stop paying or am unable to pay a subscription fee. I am using github because it's free and thus I have a better chance of longevity.

Content is easier to preserve when it's in a plain text and not locked in a database or embedded in html.

I am boycotting Facebook.com for their past crimes against democracy and on going [threat to democracy](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/772075523/mark-zuckerberg-offers-a-choice-the-facebook-way-or-the-china-way). I plan to remove all my content from their site and their subsidiaries and move it here.
