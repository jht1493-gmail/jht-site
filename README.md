- [About me](jht-md/README.md)

## Why?

A couple of reasons:

• Content should avoid lock-in. A google site will disappear when the subscription fee is not paid. Github is free and thus there is better chance for content longevity.

• Content is easier to preserve when it's in plain text and not locked in a database.

• Content is easier to manage when is not embedded in html and is in a human readable format such a markdown.

• Facebook.com should be boycotted for their past crimes against democracy and on going [threat to democracy](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/772075523/mark-zuckerberg-offers-a-choice-the-facebook-way-or-the-china-way). Facebook users should move all their content to a free hosting site like github.

• You should have full control of your social network, and not give it away for free to Facebook.com, a ethically compromised corporation.
