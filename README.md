John Henry Thompson - A migration of my personal web sites

[![](jht-md/_/rsrc/1295207567308/the-art-of-learning/reflections/colorized-jht-height=320&width=240.jpg)](http://www.johnhenrythompson.com/the-art-of-learning/reflections/colorized-jht.jpg?attredirects=0)

## [About me](jht-md/README.md)

## Why

• **Facebook.com** should be boycotted for their crimes against democracy and on going [threat to democracy](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/772075523/mark-zuckerberg-offers-a-choice-the-facebook-way-or-the-china-way). **Facebook.com** users should move all their content to a free hosting site like **github.com**.

• You should have full control of your content and social network, and not give it away for free to **Facebook.com**, an ethically compromised corporation.

• Content should avoid lock-in. For example, my site **johnhenrythompson.com** is hosted on google site which will disappear when the subscription fee is not paid. Alternatively **github.com** is free and thus there is a better chance for content longevity.

• Content is easier to preserve when it's in plain text and not locked in a database.

• Content is easier to manage when is not embedded in html and is in a human readable format such a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

[Facebook will pay an unprecedented \$5 billion penalty over privacy breaches.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/tech/facebook-ftc-settlement/index.html)

"The Federal Trade Commission announced a \$5 billion settlement with Facebook (FB) on Wednesday, resolving a sweeping investigation by regulators into how the company lost control over massive troves of personal data and mishandled its communications with users. It is the largest fine in FTC history — and yet still only about a month's worth of revenue for Facebook."

"Trump's bullsh\*t: Why his supporters don't care that he's lying."
"...And here's an amazing coincidence. A recent book cataloged all the synonyms for bullshit, and one
of the oldest dates back to the 1400s. It originally referred to trickery and scamming, although
its meaning has evolved to include general nonsense and insignificance. That word:
["trumpery"](https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Lexicon-Mark-Peters/dp/1101904534)..."
