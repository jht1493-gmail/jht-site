- [About me](jht-md/README.md)

- **www.johnhenrythompson.com** directory holds the html web site hosted by google sites.
- **jht-md** is the google site convert to markdown using scripts in director **aa**.
- Why? I don't want to be locked into google sites. Once I stop paying subscription fee my google site will disappear. Since github is hosting for free I have a better change of longevity here.
