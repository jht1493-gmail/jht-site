## [About me](jht-md/README.md)

## Why

• **Facebook.com** should be boycotted for their crimes against democracy and on going [threat to democracy](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/772075523/mark-zuckerberg-offers-a-choice-the-facebook-way-or-the-china-way). **Facebook.com** users should move all their content to a free hosting site like **github.com**.

• You should have full control of your content and social network, and not give it away for free to **Facebook.com**, an ethically compromised corporation.

• Content should avoid lock-in. For example, my site **johnhenrythompson.com** is hosted on google site which will disappear when the subscription fee is not paid. Alternatively **github.com** is free and thus there is a better chance for content longevity.

• Content is easier to preserve when it's in plain text and not locked in a database.

• Content is easier to manage when is not embedded in html and is in a human readable format such a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

[Facebook will pay an unprecedented \$5 billion penalty over privacy breaches.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/tech/facebook-ftc-settlement/index.html)

"The Federal Trade Commission announced a \$5 billion settlement with Facebook (FB) on Wednesday, resolving a sweeping investigation by regulators into how the company lost control over massive troves of personal data and mishandled its communications with users. It is the largest fine in FTC history — and yet still only about a month's worth of revenue for Facebook."
