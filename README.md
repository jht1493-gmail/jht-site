## What's here.

[www_johnhenrythompson_com](www_johnhenrythompson_com) html web site copied from [google sites](http://www.johnhenrythompson.com) using [sitesucker app](https://ricks-apps.com/osx/sitesucker/).

[jht-md](jht-md/README.md) is the google site converted to markdown using scripts in directory [aa](aa).

## Why?

I am boycotting Facebook.com for their past crimes against democracy and on going [threat to democracy](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/772075523/mark-zuckerberg-offers-a-choice-the-facebook-way-or-the-china-way).

I plan to remove all my content from their site and their subsidiaries.

Also, I don't want to be locked into google sites. When I stop, or am unable, to paying a subscription fee my google site will disappear. Since github is hosting for free I have a better chance of longevity here. Also content is easier to preserve when it's in a plain text format and not stored in a database.
