Henry Thompson</b></font></h1>
<h1 align="left" class="bodytext11"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>My most
significant contribution to the computer industry to date is the invention of
the </b><a href="http://www.macromedia.com" target="_blank">Macromedia</a> <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/director/" target="_blank">Director
Lingo scripting language</a></font></h1>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I've also helped nurture a
generation of multimedia professionals as a graduate level college professor at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New
York University</a>, and author of the &quot;Macromedia Director Lingo
Workshop&quot; book.&nbsp;</font></p>

  <p class="bodytext11" align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Early on my
  desire was to combine art and technology</font></b>
</div>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I studied studio art at the New York
Student Art League and the Boston Museum School. I earned my degree in Computer
Science and Visual Studies from the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Massachusetts
Institute of Technology</a> in the 1983. After graduating, I continued at MIT as
a technical instructor and developed an early color pre-press design system for
the Visible Language Workshop, now part of the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT
Media Lab</a>. Following this I was a project lead at Lucas Films on the
EditDriod project, an early nonlinear editing system.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I have created art using 3D
graphics, video disc, and real-time video processing. Some of my interactive art
installations have been exhibited internationally.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">My interest in both art and
technology lead me to <a href="http://www.macromedia.com" target="_blank">Macromedia</a>
(formerly MacroMind). From 1987, at Macromedia I developed a number of products,
including: The VideoWorks Accelerator, VideoWorks II, MediaMaker, Action, and
Macromedia Director. I created for a number of core technologies including the
Lingo Scripting engine. Until I left the company in 2001, I held the position of
Chief Scientist, the highest engineering position at Macromedia.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">While creating multimedia tools, I
was also a professor at New York University's graduate <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">Interactive
Telecommunications Program (ITP)</a>. From 1988 to 1997 at ITP I developed and
taught five different courses at ITP covering various aspects of interactive
design and programming. Drawing upon experience teaching my Lingo scripting
language, I wrote and published the book &quot;Macromedia Director Lingo
Workshop.&quot; The book is a popular guide to the Lingo programing language and
was published in two editions and translated to Japanese, German, and Italian.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I now live in the San Francisco Bay
Area with my wife and four children.</font></p>
