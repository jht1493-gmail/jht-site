The Digital Jam 2.0 Mobile Applications Development workshop will help young developers move ahead of the technical curve by specializing in cutting edge technologies that let developers build effective native mobile applications (e.g.  for the iPhone and Android  or Blackberry phones) using cross-platform tools that deliver greater flexibility and speed to market.

The five days of intensive development support will focus on two key objectives:

1\. Support development of skills of all participants – from beginners to advanced programmers – as needed for to work as a team to implement commercial-strength mobile application.

2\. Establish the partnerships between creative/art practitioners and engineering/programming specialist as needed to deliver uniquely exciting offerings.

Mobile application development requires programming and art skills and course work typically programing covered a by 12 week course at college level. The 5 day workshop can only give a taste and provide assistance to people already along this path.

The approach will be open and dynamic, with the activities of each day depending of the progress made on the previous day and the needs of the participants.  After the first day of team and individual assessments, sessions will be structured to meet the differing needs of beginning, intermediate and advanced programmers. One will not need to attend all sessions for the workshop to meet your needs.
