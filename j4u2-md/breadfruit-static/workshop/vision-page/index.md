Vision
======

**The vision:** Export an innovative software development strategy to enable Jamaican youth to prosper in the global internet knowledge economy.

**The question:** Is a cutting edge software development and educational approach transferable to the youth of Jamaica and can it be the means to open up new opportunities for them in the internet economy?

[John Henry Thompson](http://www.johnhenrythompson.com/bio) will attempt to address this question by participating in the lead up to a [Mobile App contest](http://digijam.biz/profiles/blogs/worldbank-app-competition) and by leading a workshop at the up coming [Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) in Jamaica, West Indies.

Technology has rapidly evolved from low cost desktop computers to web/mobile platforms and the barrier to entry is constantly dropping for anyone, anywhere in the world, with the right skill set to be a creative participant. John Henry, has been working, teaching, and exploring the emerging edge of technology for over 30 years, and in recent years partnered with [EP Visual Design](http://epvisual.com) to deliver content management, training, and mobile solutions to a variety of clients, from large corporations to small business. The team at  EP Visual  builds on affordable web hosting back-ends (php, coldfusion, etc.), web standards (html5, jQuery, etc.), to create mobile applications ([SiteClone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/siteclone-browser/id363383408?mt=8) and [Synthes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/synthes/id394817085?mt=8) apps) and  custom content management and training systems ([ttlms.com](http://ttlms.com)). From John Henry’s professional experience and that of the  EP Visual team,  an effective development and learning methodology can be shared with Jamaica via Mobile App contest mentoring and a Hackathon  workshop. The [EP Visual team](http://j4u2.com/breadfruit-static/ep-visual/) includes [Jervis Thompson](http://www.jervo.com),  [Phil Sinatra](http://www.philsinatra.com/), and Jay Kellett. Jervis and Phil are professors of digital media at Drexel University. John Henry was a professor of digital media for over 8 years at [New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, ITP.](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/)

John Henry does not presume his approach is the right one for Jamaica, or people working in Jamaica. This engagement can be seen as a opportunity to share the methodology and gather information about what modifications, if any, would work best for Jamaica. A dialog and sharing to address the initial question will be established by working remotely via email and Skype video conferencing and, if deemed appropriate, documented via a blog  hosted and maintained by  John Henry  for the duration of the engagement.
