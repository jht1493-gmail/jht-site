**Jay R. Kellett, M.S., Systems Developer**

Jay Kellett has more than 21 years of experience in designing and developing interactive multimedia training. He has managed the development of more than 100 training and learning solutions.

Mr. Kellett is an expert in multiple authoring tools, learning management systems (e.g., Plateau, SABA, Geolearning, BlackBoard), SCORM and AICC, and Section 508 compliance. He regularly teaches seminars on Adobe Director and ColdFusion and has written several books for Adobe/Macromedia Press, including the Certified Adobe/Macromedia Dreamweaver Developer Study Guide.

In addition, Mr. Kellett has served as Chief Technology Officer at two companies. He has concentrated on the implementation of large training systems within several large organizations including PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Barnett International, and the Guardian Life Insurance Company

Currently developing SCORM and 508-compliant courseware for:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) – Flight Standards Service and Aircraft

Certification Service

 Transportation Security Administration

 Farm Services Agency

 Federal Emergency Management Agency

All FAA development work included the following activities:

 Section 508, usability and learning management system (LMS) compatibility

testing based on FAA technical specifications, standards and acceptance criteria

 eLMS (eLearning Management System) Acceptance Testing

Directed the technical development of a hybrid learning solution using leading-edge technology for the Financial Institution Analysis School for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection. The curriculum teaches bank examiners how to analyze banks’ financial information in order to assess their risk exposure and risk management controls. The modules are interactive and based upon measurable performance requirements. Learners must pass a pre-workshop qualification examination prior to attending the workshop. The examination and modules are integrated with FDIC’s LMS.

Directed the development of an information security awareness curriculum for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Participated in the design and prototyping of the Consumer Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (Consumer EDIE) for FDIC. This electronic performance support system teaches consumers about deposit insurance, and allows consumers to enter account information and receive a report of their deposit insurance coverage

Directed the development of an integrated instructional systems design (ISD) process with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The project addresses FAA’s need to optimize effective training for new software systems. The project also involves development of classroom training for project managers on the FAA’s SDLC.

Directed the development of more than eight web-based skills assessment systems for a variety of Federal clients, including FDIC and the Department of Health and Human Services. The systems include multi-rater assessment and reporting. All courses were Section 508 compliant and interfaced successfully with the agencies’ LMS.
