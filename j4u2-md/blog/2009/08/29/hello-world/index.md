### [Hello world!](index.md)

I plan to transition my current personal web site to a dynamic one, using some of the popular CMS/PHP frameworks, such as:

*   WordPress
*   Apostrophe/Symphony
*   Drupal

Installed wordpress for by blog. Install top few themes and a few that caught my eye:

*   **/pixel/**
*   **/ahimsa/**
*   **/atahualpa/**
*   **/classic/**
*   **/default/**
*   **/dfblog/**
*   **/index.php**
*   **/indy10/**
*   **/inove/**
*   **/lightword/**

Trying out **theme atahualpa** first. It’s got tons of options. Which maybe why blog appears sluggish sometimes. I choose **theme atahuala** because it has categories and pages on the left wont push down the login, which is on the right.
