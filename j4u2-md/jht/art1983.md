Stills for a 3-D computer generated animation "Launch", created at the Visible Language Workshop department at MIT during the period 1983-84. I wrote the modeling software, built the hardware controller to connect the main computer to the 1-inch Apex video tape recorder, and created the animation. I spent several months building the entire system. The computer would run over night for about 8 hours to render and record frame-by-frame a few seconds of animation.

Stills from a music video "Color Dance" created at the Visible Language Workshop at MIT during the period 1983-84. The dancers pictured are Countney Grey, an MIT student at the time, and his troupe. I programmed the computer frame buffer to create colorized video in real-time. I also directed and edited the video.
