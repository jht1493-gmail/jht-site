Articles on computer games and learning by JHT

From humble beginnings in 1974 with a New York City affirmative action funded after-school program, John H. Thompson (MIT '83) became the author of the most widely used computer programming language in interactive media. Known worldwide as simply "JT", Thompson is the inventor and chief architect of "Lingo". Lingo is best known as the programming language used to create computer games with Macromedia's Shockwave. Lingo makes it possible for non-programmers to develop computer games. Shockwave is the primary way to present interactive games on the Internet. Over 100 million people use Shockwave.
