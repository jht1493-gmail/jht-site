**the book**

This book is a step-by-step approach to learning Lingo, the scripting language for Macromedia Director, which is the premier multimedia authoring tool. You can use Director to create interactive projects that combine text, sound, graphics, animation, and digital video. Director�s Lingo scripting language gives you greater control over these multimedia elements. With Lingo, many developers have created multimedia works for education, entertainment, and business. These works can be delivered in a variety of medium for play back on Macintosh,Windows, and several other platforms. Director movies can be distributed on networks, hard drives, floppy disks, and CD-ROM. A few representative CD-ROM titles are: Total Distortion, Iron Helix, The Journeyman Project, Yearn2Learn Peanuts, Rodney Greenblat�s Dazzeloids, and Macromedia�s Showcase CD. On the World Wide Web there are an ever growing number of "Shocked" sites that incorporated Director movies using the freely distributed Director Shockwave Player. Thousands of these sites are listed in the Shockwave Epicenter at [http://www.macromedia.com](http://www.macromedia.com/).

This book is designed to teach Lingo to people with no prior scripting background. We assume that you know how to use Director to create animation and control the Score. Lingo concepts are introduced gradually with practical examples. Exercises and reviews are used to help build understanding and retention. Concepts are richly illustrated to promote visualization and help build understanding.
