7\. Covid19 Visual - John Henry Thompson - Invent Your Future  


### 7\. Covid19 Visual

A web site to visualize covid-19 statistics from John Hopkins University.

The site is updated daily.

**Purpose:**

More than numbers, I hope the site will help contribute to answering these questions:

- How to mourn and memorialize the thousands dying everyday from the COVID-19 pandemic?
-
- How to assess the impact on the families and the communities of the deceased?
-
- How to build enduring institutions to mitigate their suffering and address systemic inequalities?

**Roadmap for site:**

This is a work-in-progress currently only showing country level statistics.

The rough plan is to extend along this roadmap:

\- publish public repo for other developers

\- drill down to community level statistics

\- connect to statistics on frontline workers.

\- support community driven mourning
