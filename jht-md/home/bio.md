> My most significant contribution to the computer industry to date is the invention of the [Macromedia](http://www.macromedia.com/) [Director Lingo scripting language](http://www.macromedia.com/software/director/)

I've also helped nurture a generation of multimedia professionals as a graduate level college professor at [New York University](http://itp.nyu.edu/), and author of the "[Macromedia Director Lingo Workshop](http://www.j4u2.com/jht/lingoworkshop.html)" book.

I studied studio art at the New York Student Art League and the Boston Museum School. I earned my degree in Computer Science and Visual Studies from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/) in the 1983. After graduating, I continued at MIT as a technical instructor and developed an early color pre-press design system for the Visible Language Workshop, now part of the [MIT Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu/). Following this I was a project lead at Lucas Films on the EditDriod project, an early nonlinear editing system.

I have created art using 3D graphics, video disc, and real-time video processing. Some of my interactive art installations have been exhibited internationally.

My interest in both art and technology lead me to [Macromedia](http://www.macromedia.com/) (formerly MacroMind). From 1987, at Macromedia I developed a number of products, including: The VideoWorks Accelerator, VideoWorks II, MediaMaker, Action, and Macromedia Director. I created for a number of core technologies including the Lingo Scripting engine. Until I left the company in 2001, I held the position of Chief Scientist, the highest engineering position at Macromedia.

While creating multimedia tools, I was also a professor at New York University's graduate [Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)](http://itp.nyu.edu/). From 1988 to 1997 I developed and taught five different courses covering various aspects of interactive design and programming. Drawing upon experience teaching my Lingo scripting language, I wrote and published the book "[Macromedia Director Lingo Workshop](http://www.j4u2.com/jht/lingoworkshop.html)." The book is a popular guide to the Lingo programing language and was published in two editions and translated to Japanese, German, and Italian.
