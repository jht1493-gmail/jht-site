Activity:

Find out about and visit a creative learning space in your local area.

By "creative learning space," we're thinking of a place in which people are creating projects --and learning from each other as part of the process.

Here are some questions you may want to note when visiting. You could focus on one or two, and share back to the group.  If you are already an active participant, share your experience.

6.  Projects \- What kinds of projects are people working on? How would you describe the range or diversity of projects?
7.  Interests - Where do the ideas for the projects come from? Are the projects based on individual, group, or community interests?
8.  Learning Community - Do people help each other learn?  Are there mentors in the space? Is there a trajectory of participation from newcomer to leadership roles?
9.  Values - How do people treat each other in the community? Are there community guidelines or values that are discussed or agreed upon?
10.  Space - Which aspects of the physical space support the creative learning process? What materials are available?

Roger Malina (2013:  
John Maeda, President of the Rhode Island School of Design instigated compelling testimony to the U.S. Congress (STEMtoSTEAM.org, n.d.) articulating three types of arguments. First is the “creativity and innovation argument” that good ideas often come from friction or exploration at the boundaries of disciplines. Second, the ‘jobs of the future’ argument; that no government predicted the explosive growth of the game industries and social media industries, but many of the concepts came out of the arts and humanities community, and the cultural sector....The third argument is the ‘social and cultural innovation argument’. Most inventions are never socially adopted often for no good reason than the lack of design of the cultural appropriation process. We live in ‘silos’ even in this networked age (that often reinforces like-minded connectivity rather than divergent thinking). In the innovation industry there are now ‘accelerators’ that act as transitional spaces between the R and D and business incubator environment (Healthbox, n.d.).

Geetha Narayanan:  
Dangerous ideas...  challenge the dominant paradigms of the time and can be described as heretic (Brockman 2006).  
The dangerous idea is that school reform, in India in particular, but across the world too, is impossible.  
\- wellness, not survival  
\- self & planet  
\- stories  
\- slow learning

Learning Match (extra activity)

1) Think of something you’re willing to teach to another participant in the course. And think of something you would like to learn.

2) Later in the week, we will provide a matching tool to connect teachers and learners.

Reflections:

Papert described powerful ideas as general (applicable across domains), intelligible (easy to grasp), and personal (rooted in experience). Share an example of a powerful idea from your own experience. What people, materials, or environments supported your learning experience? How might you help others understand and appreciate this powerful idea?

Activity:

Create a project with[TurtleArt](http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/software/turtleart/), and reflect on any “powerful ideas” you engaged with in the process. (For more background, see[TurtleArt paper](http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/readings/TurtleArt.pdf) below.)

Alan Kay:  
In order to be completely enfranchised in the 21st century, it will be very important for children to get fluent in the three central forms of thinking that are now in use: "stories," "logical arguments," and "systems dynamics." The question is "how?" (Hard Fun, persisting in face of failure, failure as lesson )  
"children are willing to go to any lengths to learn very difficult things and endure almost an endless succession of "failures" in the process if they have a sense that the activity is an integral part of their culture." - "rite of passage" motivation.  
\- "create an embedded environment and support classroom teachers with visiting experts"  
\- children start off loving to learn, and most can learn anything the culture throws at them. But they are best at learning ideas that seem to be an integral part of the surrounding culture  
\- aim at being idea based, not media based  
  
Powerful idea: My dad saying "You can accomplish anything you set your mind to with the right education." and me believing it.
