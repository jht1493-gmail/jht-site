"A fundamental challenge for  
cultures of participation is to  
conceptualize, create, and evolve  
socio-technical environments that  
not only technically enable and  
support users’ participation, but  
also successfully encourage it."  
  
"Will the power of the  
collective human mind aided by  
technology improve further or are  
there major drawbacks to come  
(as Socrates argued would be the  
consequences of reading and writing)?"  
[Thoth challenge](../../heros/professor-john-fray/thoth.html) - every technology has positive / negative.  
  
• Meta-design  
• Social creativity,  
• Richer ecologies of participation
