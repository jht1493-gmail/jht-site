I was heading in a similar direction when I prepared for an mobile application develop course that I taught last year

My cycle is Vision-Explore-Create-Reflect  
Somewhat similar to to Imagine-Create-Play-Share-Reflect.  
The visualization as a spiral is better than my closed circle.  
  
Maybe for me Create-Play is more like Exploring,  
I typically explore an area before I create something.  
In my personal experience I have not done much sharing of my experimental stuff.  
I'm hoping to use this course as an opportunity to make a change and share more.
