"tinkering with tinkerability"  
  

Mindfest - 1999. take mindstorm beyond robots contest.  
  

Playful Invention & Exploration Network  
  

Mike & Karen: at exploratorium tinkering studio.  
robots to create enironment - shadows and light.  

floor based programs  

being comfortable to being uncomfortable. don't avoid failure.  

enviroment designed to support learning exploring  

how to get started: others engaged / residue of past projects.  

tinkering: comfortable with learning a phenonmenom / play with problem more than solve it / developing these instincts  

makes sense as you go along, then share with others.  

  

Tinkering vs. planing  
  
Eric Rosenbaum: Makey Makey (with Jay). Developed in exploratorium.  
Designing for Tinkerability:  

\- immediate feed back  

\- Fluid experimentation: easy to try things out  

\- Open exploration: try out lots of things.  
  

Transform your problem in to a space that you can tinker and explore.  
  

Conversation with material -material can talk back.  
  

Challenge is how to assess the learning since it make have impact over time. Using an ethographic approach to capture learning. Video doc to find exemplar moments.  
  

Wipe out phenonmenon - remembering the beginners mind.  
  

\> Next two weeks: think about building course into community.
