"little c" - personal creativity  
  

**Imagine  
**materials not over-constrained or over\-determine  
"many paths, many styles"  
eg. Cricket \[art + technology\] - girl friendly vs. Mindstorm robotic kit  
design challenge \- easy to learn / open ended.  
  
**Create**  
Friedrich Frobel 1837  
Frobel's Gifts  
design for designers  
Seymour Paperts constructionist approach  
  
**Play**  
Piaget: "Play is the work of children"  
experimentation, exploration, testing boundaries  
active: play & learn  
passive: education, entertainment  
Yasmin Kafai "Minds in Play"  
Scratch: "tinkerability"  
  
**Share**  
Most difficult  
Vygotsky - social nature of learning  
Henry Jenking "participatory culture"  
Scratch  
Scratch Website \- share construction  
  
**Reflect**  
Reggio Emilia, Italy  
engage children in reflecting on the process of design  
  
Tips:  

Start Simple  
Work on Thinks that you like  
If you have no clue what to do, fiddle around  
Don't be afraid to experiment  
\[\] Find a friend to work with, share ideas!  
It's ok to copy stuff (to give you an idea)  
Keep your ideas in a sketch book  
Build, take apart, rebuild  
Lots of things can go wrong, stick to it  

  
**Imagine**  
Iteration heart of creative process  
iterate on tools and use of tools  
minimum prototype to get feedback  
  

* * *

  
  
  

**Sharing & Reflecting**  
spiral, jumping levels  
leverage time/effort  
every tool creates a box, how to break out of the box,  
or how to step to next level  
  
recognize appropriate use of each tool  
eg. reading on computer screen vs. print vs ipad  
  
reading vs. taking notes  
  
problem solving vs. exploring  
  
[pro/con of each technology](../../heros/professor-john-fray/thoth.md)  
  
sharing is key to provide motivation to engage in creative cycle - the fuel for the process.  
  
ability to reflect (and focus) is key now with all the dangers of unfocused attention - facebook / tweeter / instant notification / always on technology / instant access to social network  
  
our ability to Share at odds with time to Reflect  
  
My personal work style  
\- find on desktop  
\- read on ipad  
\- notes on paper  
\- ideas on paper  
\- write in cafe  
  
My carrot - sharing to empower / feeding the motivated / reaching and helping eager learner / helping: the gift that never diminishes / passing the flame.  
  
  
**Share**  
[Khan Academy vs. Bret Victor "Learnable Programming"](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)

My sharing: [collaboration with Benjamin](http://www.j4u2.com/jht/art1988.html), Macromedia products, teaching at NYU/ITP  
  
Todays challenge: sharing made easy with Facebook & Tweeter, but more opportunity for distractions  
  
plan to use github to share my stuff

**Reflect**  
focus is prerequisite -  [meditation as an aide](../../yoga/patanjani/book-1/12.md).  
should be preferred way to assess students progress - artifacts from their reflection  

  

\- where does integrating new knowledge come in?

\- must rely on trusted source.
