April1: Learning in Communities (Session 7)

Panelists: Geetha Narayanan, Natalie Rusk

Readings in Preparation for Session 7:

\* Natalie Rusk, Mitchel Resnick, & Stina Cooke (2009):[Origins and Guiding Principles of the Computer Clubhouse](http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Emres/papers/Clubhouse/clubhouse-origins.pdf), in The Computer Clubhouse: Constructionism and Creativity in Youth Communities.  

- En Español from Eduteka.org: [Origen y Principios Guía del Club Juvenil de Informática](http://www.eduteka.org/modulos/9/272/2077/1)

Geetha Narayanan (2007): [A Dangerous but Powerful Idea](http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-13/narayaran/)

Activity:

Find out about and visit a creative learning space in your local area.

By "creative learning space," we're thinking of a place in which people are creating projects --and learning from each other as part of the process.

Here are some questions you may want to note when visiting. You could focus on one or two, and share back to the group.  If you are already an active participant, share your experience.

6.  Projects \- What kinds of projects are people working on? How would you describe the range or diversity of projects?
7.  Interests - Where do the ideas for the projects come from? Are the projects based on individual, group, or community interests?
8.  Learning Community - Do people help each other learn?  Are there mentors in the space? Is there a trajectory of participation from newcomer to leadership roles?
9.  Values - How do people treat each other in the community? Are there community guidelines or values that are discussed or agreed upon?
10.  Space - Which aspects of the physical space support the creative learning process? What materials are available?

Roger Malina (2013:  
John Maeda, President of the Rhode Island School of Design instigated compelling testimony to the U.S. Congress (STEMtoSTEAM.org, n.d.) articulating three types of arguments. First is the “creativity and innovation argument” that good ideas often come from friction or exploration at the boundaries of disciplines. Second, the ‘jobs of the future’ argument; that no government predicted the explosive growth of the game industries and social media industries, but many of the concepts came out of the arts and humanities community, and the cultural sector....The third argument is the ‘social and cultural innovation argument’. Most inventions are never socially adopted often for no good reason than the lack of design of the cultural appropriation process. We live in ‘silos’ even in this networked age (that often reinforces like-minded connectivity rather than divergent thinking). In the innovation industry there are now ‘accelerators’ that act as transitional spaces between the R and D and business incubator environment (Healthbox, n.d.).

Geetha Narayanan:  
Dangerous ideas...  challenge the dominant paradigms of the time and can be described as heretic (Brockman 2006).  
The dangerous idea is that school reform, in India in particular, but across the world too, is impossible.  
\- wellness, not survival  
\- self & planet  
\- stories  
\- slow learning

Computer Club House Principles

1\. Learn by design

2\. Following your interests

3\. Building a community

\- work together

\- build on each others ideas

\- mentors build too, teach by example

4\. Respect & Trust
