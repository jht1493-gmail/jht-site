### Patanjali's Yoga Sutras - A Comparison

After taking yoga classes for a while someone asked me what is "Raja Yoga." I wasn't sure but I thought it had something to do with royalty or nobility - like the four noble truths of Buddhism. I wasn't happy with the vagueness of my answer and decided to research.

Raja Yoga is defined in the ancient text Patanjani's Yoga Sutras. Written circa 5,000 B.C. - 300 A.D, the Sutras are organized into four books:

[Book 1](patanjani/book-1.html) [Book 2](patanjani/book-2.html) [Book 3](patanjani/book-3.html) [Book 4](patanjani/book-4.html)

The Yoga Sutras have been translated and commented on by many authors over many centuries. Here I compare a few of these translations.

James H. Woods, a Havard professor of philosophy in the early 1900's gives a very detailed translation of Patanjani's Yoga Sutras along with early commentary and explanations by other authors. His entire work is available online, thanks to google digital book. Thank you google for providing such flexible online access to public domain content.

My motivation for this study is related to what Patanjani writes in Book 1 sentence 39. He gives suggestions to eliminate our misconceptions, including:

**यथाभिमतध्यानाद्वा ॥३९॥**  
yathā-abhimata-dhyānād-vā ||39||

(**यथ**, yatha) = how  
(**आभिमत**, ābhimata) = love  
(**ध्यानाद्**, dhyānād) = meditation  
(**वा**, vā) = or

[\[RS\] 1.39 Or through contemplation (dhyana) of love.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/yatha-abhimata-dhyanad-va-39)

[\[JW\] 1.39 Or \[the mind stuff reaches the stable state\] by contemplation upon any such an object as is desired.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA77&ci=150%2C314%2C699%2C54&source=bookclip) [\[Image\]](http://www.johnhenrythompson.com/yoga/patanjani/Book1-39.png?attredirects=0)
