### 4.31

**तदा सर्वावरणमलापेतस्य ज्ञानस्यानन्त्यात् ज्ञेयमल्पम् ॥३१॥**  
tada sarva avarana malapetasya jnanasya anantyat jneyamalpam ||31||  
  

[\[RS\] 4.31 Then all veils and uncertainty fall away. Knowledge that can be gained is nothing compared to the infinity of knowledge.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-4/item/tada-sarva-avarana-malapetasya-jnanasya-anantyat/)

[\[JW\] 4.31 Then because of the endlessness of knowledge from which all obscuring defilements have passed away, what is yet to be known amounts to little.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA342&ci=177%2C307%2C774%2C80&source=bookclip)

[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 4.31 Then all the coverings and impurities of knowledge are totally removed. Because of the infinity of this knowledge, what remains to be know is almost nothing. \[p228\]
