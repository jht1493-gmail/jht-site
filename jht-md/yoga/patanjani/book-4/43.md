### 4.3

**निमित्तमप्रयोजकं प्रकृतीनांवरणभेदस्तु ततः क्षेत्रिकवत् ॥३॥**  
nimittam aprayojakam prakritinam varana bhedastu tatah kshetrikavat ||3||  
  

[\[RS\] 4.3 However, outer causes are not sufficient to bring about inner change, which can be likened to a farmer removing a sluice gate so as to allow water to irrigate his rice field so that rice can grow there.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-4/item/nimittam-aprayojakam-prakritinam-varana-bhedastu/)  

[\[JW\] 4.3 The efficient cause gives no impulse to the evolving-causes but \[the mutation\] follows when the barrier \[to the evolving cause\] is cut, as happens with the peasant.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA301&ci=76%2C736%2C771%2C88&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 4.3 Incidental events do not directly cause natural evolution; they just remove the obstacles as a farmer \[removes the obstacles in a water course running to his field\]. \[p208\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 4.3 The instrumental cause of creation is not its creative cause, but it pierces the covering from creation like a farmer \[pierces the barriers between his fields\]. \[p409\]
