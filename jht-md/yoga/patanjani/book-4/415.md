### 4.15

**वस्तुसाम्ये चित्तभेदात्तयोर्विभक्तः पन्थाः ॥१५॥**  
vastusamye chitta bhedat tayorvibhaktah panthah ||15||  
  

[\[RS\] 4.15 That which is mutable in us (chitta) takes various paths to the same object, perception of which thus differs from one person another.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-4/item/vastusamye-chitta-bhedat-tayorvibhaktah-panthah/)  

[\[JW\] 4.15 Because, while the \[physical\] thing remains the same, the mind-stuffs are different, \[therefore the two are upon\] distinct levels-of-existence.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA323&ci=67%2C277%2C784%2C80&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 4.15 Due to differences in various minds, perception of even the same object may vary. \[p214\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 4.15 Because there is a multiplicity of minds \[perceiving an object\] but yet the object remains consistent, there is a difference in nature between the object and the mind \[of the observer\]. \[p431\]
