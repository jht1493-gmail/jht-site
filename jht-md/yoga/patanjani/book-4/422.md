[\[RW\] 4.22 Unlike the characteristic of that which is immutable in human beings, the true self is unchangeable and can thus achieve full knowledge and self knowledge.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-4/item/chiter-aprati-sankramayah-akara-apattau-svabuddhi/)  
  
[\[JW\] 4.22 The Intellect (citi) which unites not \[with objects\] is conscious of its own thinking-substance when \[the mind-stuff\] takes the form of that \[thinking-substance by reflecting it\].](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA332&ci=181%2C1001%2C793%2C111&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 4.22 The consciousness of the Purusha is unchangeable; by getting the reflection of it, the mind-stuff becomes conscious of the Self. \[p219\]
