### 4.9

**जाति देश काल व्यवहितानामप्यान्तर्यां स्मृतिसंस्कारयोः एकरूपत्वात् ॥९॥**  
jati desha kala vyavahitanam apy antaryam smriti sanskarayoh ekarupatvat ||9||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 4.9 Even if modality, place and time cease to exist, the continuity of wish and consequences remains, for remembrance (smriti) and impressions (samskaras) are part of the same being.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-4/item/jati-desha-kala-vyavahitanam-antaryam-smriti/)  
  
[\[JW\] 4.9 There is an uninterrupted \[causal\] relation \[of sub-conscious-impressions\], although remote in species and point-of-space and moment-of-time, by reason of the correspondence between memory and subliminal-impressions.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA307&ci=88%2C447%2C777%2C118&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 4.9 Although desires are separated from their fulfillments by class, space and time, they have an uninterrupted relationship because the impressions \[of desires\] and memories of them are identical. \[p212\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 4.9 Because they are identical, there is an uninterrupted connection between memory and samskara, even though they might be separated by birth, time and place. \[p419\]
