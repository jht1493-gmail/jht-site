### 3.53

**जातिलक्षणदेशैः अन्यतानवच्छेदात् तुल्ययोः ततः प्रतिपत्तिः ॥५३॥**  
jati lakshana deshaih anyata anavachchhedat tulyayoh tatah pratipattih ||53||  
  
[\[RS\] 3.53 This gives rise to knowledge of distinction between two similar objects that are not normally distinguishable on the basis of their category, characteristics, or position in space.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/jati-lakshana-deshaih-anyata-anavachchhedat/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.53 As a result of this there arises the deeper-knowledge of two equivalent things which cannot be distinctly qualified in species or characteristic-mark or point-of-space.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA290&ci=201%2C413%2C731%2C85&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.54 Thus, the indistinguishable differences between objects that are alike in species, characteristic marks and positions become distinguishable. \[p202\]
