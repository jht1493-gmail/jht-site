[\[RS\] 3.51 When the celestial beings beckon, the yogi should avoid forming any attachment to this complacency, since this contact can reinstate undesirable attachment.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/sthany-nimantrane-sanga-smaya-akaranam-punar/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.51 In case of invitations from those-in-high-places, these should arouse no attachment or pride, for undesired consequences recur.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA285&ci=85%2C467%2C752%2C79&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.52 The Yogi should neither accept nor smile with pride at the admiration of even the celestial beings, as there is the possibility of his getting caught again in the undesirable. \[p201\]
