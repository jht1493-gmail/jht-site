### 3.22

**सोपक्रमं निरुपक्रमं च कर्म तत्संयमातपरान्तज्ञानम् अरिष्टेभ्यो वा ॥२२॥**  
sopa-kramaṁ nirupa-kramaṁ ca karma tatsaṁyamāt-aparāntajñānam ariṣṭebhyo vā ||22||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 3.22 Meditation (samyama) on foreseeable and unforeseeable causes and causal relationships (karma) gives rise to knowledge (jnana) concerning fate.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/sopa-kramam-nirupa-kramam-karma-tatsanyamat/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.22 Advancing and not-advancing is karma, as a result of constraint upon this \[two-fold karma\] or from the signs of death \[there arises an intuitive\] knowledge of the latter end.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA251&ci=88%2C174%2C759%2C89&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.22 In the same way, the disappearance of sound \[touch, taste, smell, etc.\] is explained. \[p186\]  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.23 Karmas are of two kinds: quickly manifesting and slowly manifesting. By samyama on them, or on the portents of death, the knowledge of the time of death is obtained. \[p187\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 3.22 Karma is ether quick to fructify or slow. By samyama on karma, or on portents, knowledge of \[one's\] death arises. \[p348\]
