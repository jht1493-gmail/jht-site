### 3.21

**कायरूपसंयमात् तत्ग्राह्यशक्तिस्तम्भे चक्षुः प्रकाशासंप्रयोगेऽन्तर्धानम् ॥२१॥**  
kāya-rūpa-saṁyamāt tat-grāhyaśakti-stambhe cakṣuḥ prakāśāsaṁprayoge-'ntardhānam ||21||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 3.21 Through meditation on the form of one's own physical body, it becomes possible to impede the capacity that renders the body visible. This precludes a connection between light and the eyes and renders the body invisible to others.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/kaya-rupa-sanyamat-grahyashakti-stambhe-chakshuh/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.21 As a result of constraint upon the \[outer\] form of the body, when its power to be known is stopped, then as a consequence of the disjunction of the light and of the eye there follows indiscernibility \[of the yogin's body\].](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA250&ci=156%2C407%2C784%2C115&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.21 By samyama on the form of one's body, \[and by\] checking the power of perception by intercepting light from the eyes of the observer, the body becomes invisible. \[p186\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 3.21 By performing samyama on the outer form of the body, invisibility \[is attained\]. This occurs when perceptibility is obstructed by blocking contact between light and the eyes. \[p347\]
