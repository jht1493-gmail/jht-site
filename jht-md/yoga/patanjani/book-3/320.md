### 3.20

**न च तत् सालम्बनं तस्याविषयी भूतत्वात् ॥२०॥**  
na ca tat sālambanaṁ tasya-aviṣayī bhūtatvāt ||20||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 3.20 But we learn nothing from the true nature of another person, for they are not an object that can be perceived.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/salambanam-tasya-avishayi-bhutatvat/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.20 But \[the intuitive knowledge of the mind-stuff of another\] does not have that \[idea\] together with that upon which it depends \[as its object\], since that \[upon which it depends\] is not-in-the-field \[of consciousness\].](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA249&ci=82%2C847%2C758%2C114&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.20 But this does not include the support in the person's mind \[such as the motive behind the thought, etc.\] as that is not the object of the samyama. \[p185\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 3.20 That knowledge is not accompanied by its object, since this object is not the object \[of the yogi's mind\]. \[p346\]
