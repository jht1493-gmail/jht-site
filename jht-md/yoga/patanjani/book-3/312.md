### 3.12

**ततः पुनः शातोदितौ तुल्यप्रत्ययौ चित्तस्यैकाग्रतापरिणामः ॥१२॥**  
tataḥ punaḥ śātoditau tulya-pratyayau cittasya-ikāgratā-pariṇāmaḥ ||12||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 3.12 The transition to one-pointedness, or ekagrata-parinamah, is the transition whereby human mutability (chitta) becomes perfectly balanced between arising and subsiding.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/tatah-punah-shatoditau-tulya-pratyayau-chittasya/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.12. Then again when the quiescent and the uprisen presented-ideas are similar \[in respect of having a single object\] the mind-stuff has a mutation single-in-intent.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA211&ci=86%2C927%2C772%2C88&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.12 Then again, when the subsiding past and rising present images are identical, there is ekagrata parinama (one-pointedness). \[p181\]
