### 3.11

**सर्वार्थता एकाग्रातयोः क्षयोदयौ चित्तस्य समाधिपरिणामः ॥११॥**  
sarvārthatā ekāgrātayoḥ kṣayodayau cittasya samādhi-pariṇāmaḥ ||11||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 3.11 The transition to insight (samadhi-parinama) is characterized by the mutability in human beings (chitta) becoming progressively less scattered, whereas the tendency toward consolidation increases.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/sarvarthata-ekagratayoh-kshayodayau-chittasya/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.11 The mutation of concentration is the dwindling of dispersiveness and the uprisal of singleness-of-intent belonging to the mind-stuff.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA211&ci=86%2C272%2C736%2C85&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.11 When there is a decline in distractedness and appearance of one-pointedness, then comes samadhi parinamah (development in samadhi). \[p181\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 3.11 The attainment of the samadhi state involves the elimination of all-pointedness \[i.e., wandering\] of the mind and the rise of one-pointedness \[i.e., concentration\]. \[p318\]
