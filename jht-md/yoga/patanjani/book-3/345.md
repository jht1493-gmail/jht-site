### 3.45

**ततोऽणिमादिप्रादुर्भावः कायसंपत् तद्धरानभिघात्श्च ॥४५॥**  
tato 'nimadi pradurbhavah kayasanpat tad dharanabhighatscha ||45||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 3.35 This mastery engenders the ability to make the body appear to be extremely small, as well as attainment of an absolutely physical body and its indestructible integrity.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-3/item/tato-nimadi-pradurbhavah-kayasanpat-dharanabhighatscha/)  
  
[\[JW\] 3.45 As a result of this atomization (animan) and the other \[perfections\] come about; \[there is\] perfection of body; and there is no obstruction by the properties of these \[elements\].](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA278&ci=185%2C577%2C743%2C82&source=bookclip)  
  

[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 3.46 From that comes attainment of anima and other siddhis, bodily perfection and the non-obstruction of bodily functions by the influence of the elements \[Note: the eight major siddhis alluded to here are:  
   anima (to become very small);  
   mahima ( to be come very large);  
   laghima (very light);  
   garima (heavy);  
   prapti (to reach anywhere);  
   prakamya (to achieve all one's desires);  
   isatva (ability to command and control everything). \[p197\]
