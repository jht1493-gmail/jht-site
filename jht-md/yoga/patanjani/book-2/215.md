[\[RS\] 2.15 Suffering is caused by change in the outside world, as well as impressions, desires (samsakra), misconceptions (vritti) and conflict. Suffering is omnipresent for those who have the capacity to differentiate.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/item/parinama-tapa-sanskara-duhkhaih-guna-vritti/)  
  
[\[JW\] 2.15 As being the pains which are mutations and anxieties and subliminal impressions and by reason of the opposition of the fluctuations of the aspects (guna) - to the discriminating all is nothing but pain.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA132&ci=162%2C780%2C727%2C111&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 2.15 To one of discrimination, everything is painful indeed, due to its consequences; the anxiety and fear over losing what is gained; the resulting impressions left in the mind to create renewed cravings; and the constant conflict among the three gunas, which control the mind .  \[p100\]
