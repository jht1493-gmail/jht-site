### 2.54

**स्वविषयासंप्रयोगे चित्तस्य स्वरूपानुकारैवेन्द्रियाणां प्रत्याहारः ॥५४॥**  
svaviṣaya-asaṁprayoge cittasya svarūpānukāra-iv-endriyāṇāṁ pratyāhāraḥ ||54||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 2.54 Harmony with the emotions (pratyahara) is achieved when the senses cease to be engaged with external objects and thus that which is mutable in human beings (chitta) becomes similar to true nature.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/item/svavishaya-asanprayoge-chittasya-svarupanukara/)  
  
[\[JW\] 2.54 The withdrawal of the senses is as it were the imitation of the mind-stuff itself on the part of the organs by disjoining themselves from their objects.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA197&ci=109%2C683%2C737%2C83&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 2.54 When the senses withdraw themselves from the objects and imitate, as it were, the nature of the mind-stuff, this is pratyahara. \[p165\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 2.54 Pratyahara, withdrawal from sense objects, occurs when the senses do not come into contact with their respective sense objects. It corresponds, as it were, to the nature of the mind \[when it is withdrawn from the sense objects\]. \[p297\]
