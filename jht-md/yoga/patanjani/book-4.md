**कैवल्यपाद**  
[\[RS\]](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-4/) YOGA-SUTRA 4 - KAIVALYA PADA: ABOUT LIBERATION  
[\[JW\]](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA299&ci=308%2C231%2C285%2C114&source=bookclip) BOOK FOURTH - ISOLATION  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) KAIVALYA PADA - _Portion on Absoluteness_  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) ABSOLUTE INDEPENDENCE  
  
[Substances and subconsciousness](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PR40&ci=168%2C394%2C782%2C720&source=bookclip)  
iv. 1 - 13. Correspondence between imperceptible forms of substance and latent impressions of concentrated states.  
  

[iv. 1. Perfections proceed from birth or from drugs or from spells or from self-castigation or from concentration.](book-4/41.html)  

  

[iv. 2. The mutation into another birth is the result of the filling in of the evolving-cause.](book-4/42.html)  

  

[iv. 3. The efficient cause gives no impulse to the evolving-causes but \[the mutation\] follows when the barrier \[to the evolving cause\] is cut, as happens with the peasant.](book-4/43.html)  

  

[iv. 4. Created mind-stuffs may result from the sense-of-personality and from this alone.](book-4/44.html)  

  

[iv. 5. While there is a variety of actions, the mind-stuff which impels the many is one.](book-4/45.html)  

  

[iv. 6. Of these \[five perfections\] that which proceeds from contemplation leaves no latent-deposit.](book-4/46.html)  

  

[iv. 7. The yogin's karma is neither-white-nor-black; \[the karma\] of others is of three kinds.](book-4/47.html)  

  

[iv. 8. As a result of this there follows the manifestation of those subconscious-impressions only which correspond to the fruition of their \[karma\].](book-4/48.html)  

  

[iv. 9. There is an uninterrupted-causal-relation \[of subconscious impressions\], although remote in species and point-of-space and moment-of-time, by reason of the correspondence between memory and subliminal-impressions.](book-4/49.html)  

  

[iv. 10. Furthermore the \[subconscious-impressions\] have no beginning \[that we can set in time\] since desire is permanent.](book-4/411.html)  

  

[iv. 11. Since \[subconscious-impressions\] are associated with cause and motive and mental-substrate and stimulus, if these cease to be, then those \[subconscious impressions\] cease to be.](book-4/411.html)  

  

[iv. 12. Past and future as such exist; \[therefore subconscious impressions do not cease to be\]. For the different time forms belong to the external-aspects.](book-4/412.html)  
  
[iv. 13. These \[external-aspects with the three time-forms\] are phenomenalized \[individuals\] or subtile \[generic-forms\] and their essence is the aspects (guna).](book-4/413.html)  

  
[Polemic against Idealism](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PR40&ci=143%2C1118%2C796%2C188&source=bookclip)  
iv. 14 - 23. Knowledge of the stream of consciousness is impossible unless it be a permanent order as contrasted with a succession of transient appearances.  
  

[iv. 14. The that-ness of a thing is due to a singleness of mutation.](book-4/414.html)  

  

[iv. 15. Because, while the \[physical\] thing remains the same, the mind-stuffs are different, \[therefore the two are upon\] distinct levels of existence.](book-4/415.html)  

  

[iv. 16. And a thing is not dependent upon a single mind-stuff, \[for then in certain cases\] it could not be proved \[by that mind-stuff\], \[and\] then what would it be?](book-4/416.html)  

  

[iv. 17. A thing is known or not known by virtue of its affecting \[or not affecting\] the mind-stuff.](book-4/417.html)  

  

[iv. 18. Unintermittently the Master of that \[mind-stuff\] knows the fluctuations of mind-stuff \[and thus\] the Self undergoes-no-mutations.](book-4/418.html)  

  

[iv. 19. It does not illumine itself, since it is an object-for-sight.](book-4/419.html)  

  

[iv. 20. And there cannot be a cognition of both \[thinking-substance and thing\] at the same time.](book-4/420.html)  

  

[iv. 21. If \[one mind-stuff\] were the object-for-sight for another, there would be an infinite regress from one thinking-substance to another thinking-substance as well as confusion of memory.](book-4/421.html)  

  

[iv. 22. The Intellect (citi) which unites not \[with objects\] is conscious of its own thinking-substance when \[the mind-stuff\] takes the form of that \[thinking-substance by reflecting it\].](book-4/422.html)  

  

[iv. 23. Mind-stuff affected by the Seer and by the object-for-sight \[leads to the perception of\] all intended objects.](book-4/423.html)  

  
[Complete Self realization of the Self](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PR41&ci=93%2C584%2C807%2C626&source=bookclip)  
iv. 24 - 34. All hindrances subside; all acts of the Self are spontaneous and free; absence of limitations which thwart one who wishes to attain the ultimate ideal of his own nature.  
  

[iv. 24. This \[mind-stuff\], although diversified by countless subconscious impressions exists for the sake of another, because its nature is to produce \[things as\] combinations.](book-4/424.html)  

  

[iv. 25. For him who sees the distinction, pondering upon his own states-of-being ceases.](book-4/425.html)  

  

[iv. 26. Then the mind-stuff is borne down to discrimination onward towards Isolation.](book-4/426.html)  

  

[iv. 27. In the intervals of this \[mind-stuff\] there are other presented-ideas \[coming\] from subliminal-impressions.](book-4/427.html)  

  

[iv. 28. The escape from these \[subliminal-impressions\] is described as being like \[the escape from\] the hindrances.](book-4/428.html)  

  

[iv. 29. For one who is not usurious even in respect of Elevation, there follows in every case as a result of discriminative discernment the concentration \[called\] Rain-cloud of \[knowable\] things.](book-4/429.html)  

  

[iv. 30. Then follows the cessation of the hindrances and of karma.](book-4/430.html)  

  

[iv. 31. Then because of the endlessness of knowledge from which all obscuring defilements have passed away, what is yet to be known amounts to little.](book-4/431.html)  

  

[iv. 32. When as a result of this the aspects (guna) have fulfilled their purpose, they attain to the limit of the sequence of mutations.](book-4/432.html)  

  

[iv. 33. The positive correlate to the moment, recognized as such at the final limit of the mutation is a sequence.](book-4/433.html)  

  

[iv. 34. Isolation is the inverse generation of the aspects, no longer provided with a purpose by the Self or it is the Energy of Intellect grounded in itself.](book-4/434.html)
