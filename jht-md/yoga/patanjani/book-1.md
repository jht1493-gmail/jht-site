[i. 3 Then the Seer \[that is the Self \] abides in himself.](book-1/13.html)  
  
[i. 4 At other times it \[the Self\] takes the same form as the fluctuations \[of mind stuff\].](book-1/14.html)

[i. 12 The restriction of them is by \[means\] of practice and passion-lessness.](book-1/112.html)  
  

[i. 13 Practice is repeated exertion to the end that \[the mind  stuff\] shall have permanence in this \[restricted state\].](book-1/113.html)  
  
[i. 14 But this \[practice\] becomes confirmed when it has been cultivated for a long time and uninterruptedly and with earnest attention.](book-1/114.html)  
  
[i. 15 Passion-lessness is the consciousness of being master on the part of one who has rid himself of thirst for either seen or revealed objects.](book-1/115.html)

i. 19 - 23 The worldly approach; the spiritual approach; the combinations of methods and intensities; and the devotion to the highest Self.

[i. 21 For the keenly intense \[concentration\] is near.](book-1/121.html)

[i. 29 Thereafter comes the right knowledge of him who thinks in an inverse way and the removal of obstacles.](book-1/129.html)  
  
[i. 30 Sickness and languor and doubt and heedlessness and listlessness and worldliness (_avirati_) and erroneous perception and failure to attain any stage \[of concentration\] and instability in the state \[when attained\] - these distractions of the mind stuff are the obstacles.](book-1/130.html)

[i. 41 \[The mind stuff\] from which, as from a precious gem, fluctuations have dwindled away reaches the balanced-state, which, in the case of the knower or of the process-of-knowing or of the object-to-be-known, is in the state of resting upon \[one\] of these \[three\] and in the state of being tinged by \[one\] of these \[three\].](book-1/141.html)  
  
[i. 42 Of \[these balanced-states\] the state-balanced with deliberation is confused by reason of predicate-relations between words and intended objects and ideas.](book-1/142.html)
