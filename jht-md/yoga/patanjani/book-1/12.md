JHT:  RS is again more interpretive. JW has a long 5 pages of commentary and explanation.  
  
The modifications are restrained, not eliminated.  
  
Is there unmodified mind-stuff?  
  
How is the mind-stuff different than the mind?  
  
There are thoughts (citta) and then modifications (vrtti), is there an unmodified state of thoughts?  
  
  

(**योगः**, yogaḥ) = yoga  
(**चित्त**, citta) = all that is mutable in human beings; thoughts  
(**वृत्ति**, vṛtti) = thought-wave; mental modification; mental whirlpool  
(**निरोधः**, nirodhaḥ) = to find tranquility; to control
