[\[JW\] 1.18 The other \[concentration which is not conscious of objects\] consists of subliminal impressions only \[after objects have merged\], and follows upon that practice which effects the cessation \[of fluctuations\].](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA41&ci=104%2C1095%2C712%2C55&source=bookclip)
