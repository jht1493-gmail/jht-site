### 1.16

**तत्परं पुरुषख्यातेः गुणवैतृष्ण्यम् ॥१६॥**  
tatparaṁ puruṣa-khyāteḥ guṇa-vaitṛṣṇyam ||16||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 1.16 The highest state of imperturbability arises from the experience of the true self; in this state even the basic elements of nature lose their power over us.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/tatparam-purusha-khyateh-guna-vaitrishnyam/)  
  
[\[JW\] 1.16 This \[passionlessness\] is highest when discernment of the Self results in thirstlessness for qualities \[and not merely for objects\].](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA37&ci=114%2C905%2C727%2C88&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 1.16 When there is non-thirst for even the gunas (constituents of Nature) due to realization of the Purusha (true Self), that is supreme non-attachment. \[p28\]  
  
[\[TD\]](http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Yoga-Developing-Personal-Practice/dp/089281764X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1326228195&sr=8-5) 1.16 When an individual has achieved complete understanding of this true self, he will no longer be disturbed by the distracting influences within and around him. \[p154\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 1.16 Higher than renunciation is indifference to the gunas \[themselves\]. This stems from the perception of the purusa, soul. \[p57\]
