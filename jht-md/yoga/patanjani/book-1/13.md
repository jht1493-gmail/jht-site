**तदा द्रष्टुः स्वरूपेऽवस्थानम् ॥३॥**

[\[RS\] 1.3 For finding our true self (drashtu) entails insight into our own nature.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/tada-drashtuh-svarupe-vasthanam-3/)  
  
[\[JW\] 1.3 Then the Seer \[that is, the Self,\] abides in himself.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA13&ci=105%2C171%2C708%2C29&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\] 1.3](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) Then the Seer \[Self\] abides in His own nature. \[p6\]  
  
[\[TD\]](http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Yoga-Developing-Personal-Practice/dp/089281764X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1326228195&sr=8-5) 1.3 Then the ability to understand the object fully and correctly is apparent. \[p150\]

JHT: Searching the web for "draṣṭuḥ" lead to [TKV Desikachar](http://www.yogastudies.org/teachers-training/tkv-desikachar/) profile, and another [Yoga Sutra commentary by Madhvacharya, Michael Beloved](http://books.google.com/books?id=Nb9FGFDr_iUC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=dra%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADu%E1%B8%A5&source=bl&ots=FydCboGJLL&sig=vfhaswuwo8MinU_VPW6XeyTtQo8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qbhQT9PoPPGp0AGG3-SDDg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=dra%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADu%E1%B8%A5&f=false).  
  
Interesting concept the true self/seer/Seer. TD does not mention the true self at all. SS puts greater importance to the term referring to it as Seer/Self. EB does not give caps to seer.  
  
Is drastuh the core of what it means to be a person?  
  
Is the false self the main state we reside in?  
  
How can we be witness to the Seer? Image: mirror reflecting on it self, reflections continuing on into infinity.  
  
Is it possible be aware of the Seer?  

  

(**तदा**, tadā) = then  
(**द्रष्टुः**, draṣṭuḥ) = the true self  
(**स्व**, sva) = their own  
(**रूप**, rūpa) = form  
(**स्वरूपे**, svarūpe) = in (its) own form  
(**अवस्थानम्**, avasthānam) = residence
