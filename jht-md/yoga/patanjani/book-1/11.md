JHT: RS appears to be more an interpretation than a translation. JW gives an astonishing 5 pages of commentary and explanation of these three words.  
  
Traditionally this text is memorized by the student. In our age what is comparable? We don't need to memorize to have it readily available, but without committing to memory we can not know it as deeply. This text only to a starting point for teacher-student dialog. "The mnemonic rules" says JW.  
  

[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) Says yoga in contrast to Descartes ("Cogito, ergo sum" = "I think therefore I am"), the intellect is not part of the pure self. So it's not sufficient to think to experience the "I am", the point is what are you thinking about.  
  
  

(**अथ**, atha) = and so, now (often used to introduce explanations)  
(**योग**, yoga) = yoga, unity, oneness, harmony with yourself  
(**अनुशासनम्**, anuśāsanam) = introduction to the experience; explanation
