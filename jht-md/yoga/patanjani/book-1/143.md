### 1.43

**स्मृतिपरिशुद्धौ स्वरूपशून्येवार्थमात्रनिर्भासा निर्वितर्का ॥४३॥**  
smṛti-pariśuddhau svarūpa-śūnyeva-arthamātra-nirbhāsā nirvitarkā ||43||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 1.43 Once all previous impressions (smriti) have been purged and one’s own nature is clearly perceptible, then only the object of contemplation emanates light. This is nirvitarka samapatti.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/smriti-parishuddhau-svarupa-shunyeva-arthamatra/)  
  
[\[JW\] 1.43 When the memory is quite purified, \[that balanced-state\] - which is, as it were, empty of itself and which brightens \[into conscious knowledge\] as the intended-object and nothing more - is super deliberative.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA82&ci=143%2C631%2C759%2C105&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 1.43 When the memory is well purified, the knowledge of the object of concentration shines alone, devoid of the distinction of name and quality. This is nirvitarka samadhi, or samadhi without deliberation. \[p68\]  
  
[\[TD\]](http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Yoga-Developing-Personal-Practice/dp/089281764X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1326228195&sr=8-5) 1.43 When the direction of the mind toward the object is sustained, the ideas and memories of the past gradually recede. The mind becomes crystal clear and one with the object. At this moment there is no feeling of oneself. This is pure perception. \[p162\]  
  
[\[EB\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250508322&sr=1-1) 1.43 Nirvitarka \[samapatti\], "absorption without conceptualization," occurs when memory has been purged and the mind is empty, as it were, of its own \[reflective\] nature. Now only the object \[of meditation\] shines forth \[in its own right\]. \[p147\]
