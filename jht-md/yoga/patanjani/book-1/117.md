vitarka-vicāra-ānanda-asmitā-rupa-anugamāt-saṁprajñātaḥ ||17||  
  
  
[\[RS\] 1.17 This absolute knowledge is engendered incrementally by divination, experience, joy, and ultimately the feeling of oneness.](http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/vitarka-vichara-ananda-asmita-rupa-anugamat/)  
  
[\[JW\] 1.17 \[Concentration becomes\] conscious \[of its object\] by assuming forms either of deliberation \[upon coarse objects\] or of reflection \[upon subtile objects\] or of joy or of the feeling-of-personality.](http://books.google.com/books?id=YzFImjtOxUwC&pg=PA40&ci=155%2C466%2C712%2C107&source=bookclip)  
  
[\[SS\]](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Commentary-Satchidananda/dp/0932040381) 1.17 Samprajnata samadhi (distinguished contemplation) is accompanied by reasoning, reflecting, rejoicing and pure I-am-ness. \[p31\]  
  
[\[TD\]](http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Yoga-Developing-Personal-Practice/dp/089281764X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1326228195&sr=8-5) 1.17 Then the object is gradually understood fully. At first it is at a more superficial level. In time, comprehension becomes deeper. And finally it is total. There is pure joy in reaching such a depth of understanding. For then the individual is so much at one with the object he is oblivious to his surroundings. \[p154\]
