Attend my photohacker workshop sponsored by [scribe.org](http://scribe.org/) in philly area 4 Sessions starts April 6, 2017.[ Click here for info.](http://scribe.org/events/youth-learn-hackers-take-control-your-photos)

  

You can also go directly to my[photohacker git repo](https://github.com/jht1900/photohacker) to get workshop material.

A good way to start coding is to join a visual playground. [Scratch is my favorite.](http://scratch.mit.edu/)

  

"Scratch is designed especially for ages 8 to 16, but is used by people of all ages. Millions of people are creating Scratch projects in a wide variety of settings, including homes, schools, museums, libraries, and community centers."

Recommendations for learning to code pre-2016:

  

Here are some resources for learning computer computer science, most recently found listed first. 

  

Keep a look out for event Computer Science Education Week first Monday in December at [csedweek.org](http://csedweek.org/)  
  
Lots of resources at [csedweek.org/educate/3rdparty](http://csedweek.org/educate/3rdparty)  
  
Cool processing resource created for Computer Science Education Week: [hello.processing.org/](http://hello.processing.org/)  
  
The [computer science section of khan academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs) is a great place to explore  programming in your browser.  
  
Play and Experiment with Code at [codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/)  
  
[Here are a list of resources for mobile application development](http://www.j4u2.com/breadfruit/) I gave in Jamaica April and May of 2012.  
  

If you are just starting out, Scratch is a good first step. With it you can learn the core principle common to all programming languages: variables, conditional statements, flow control, and functions. Then if you wish you can build stand alone applications with BlitzMax, or get wildly creative with Processing. All cost zero dollars, except BlitzMax. But the true cost is the time you are willing to dedicated to learning. It may not be easy, but it can be fun.
