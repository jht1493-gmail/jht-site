2\. The Art of Learning - John Henry Thompson - Invent Your Future

### 2\. The Art of Learning

In the 1990's book "The Children's Machine" in the chapter entitled "A word for learning", Papert laments the lack of a word for "the art of learning."

More recently, and independently, the chess prodigy and martial arts champion [Josh Waitzken's](http://www.joshwaitzkin.com/) wrote a book entitled "[The Art of Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Pursuit-Excellence/dp/0743277465/ref=ed_oe_p)" and started a [foundation](http://theartoflearningproject.org/educate/jw-foundation/) on the topic.

Josh writes: ["Teachers must listen first. Students should gain a keen introspective awareness of their natural strengths and weaknesses, and build a game, a career, a way of life around that awareness."](http://theartoflearningproject.org/educate/jw-foundation/)

Here are my contributions on "The Art of Learning".
