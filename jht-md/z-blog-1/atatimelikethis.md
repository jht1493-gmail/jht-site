At a time like this, scorching irony, 

not convincing argument, is needed. 

O! had I the ability, 

and could I reach the nation’s ear, 

I would, to-day, 

pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, 

blasting reproach, 

withering sarcasm, 

and stern rebuke. 

For it is not light that is needed, but fire; 

it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. 

We need the storm, 

the whirlwind, 

and the earthquake. 

The feeling of the nation must be quickened; 

the conscience of the nation must be roused; 

the propriety of the nation must be startled; 

the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; 

and its crimes against God 

and man must be proclaimed and denounced.
