Your Y-chromosome results identify you as a member of haplogroup E1b1a (M2).

The genetic markers that define your ancestral history reach back roughly 60,000 years to the first common marker of all non-African men, M168, and follow your lineage to present day, ending with M2, the defining marker of haplogroup E1b1a (M2)....

You are descended from an ancient African lineage. Today, most Africans in sub-Saharan Africa share this lineage. In North Africa, this haplogroup is found at frequencies of five to ten percent among Berbers, Tunisians, and Moroccan Arabs. Because it is also predominant in West Africa, many African-Americans also trace their genetic history to this line of descent. Members of this haplogroup can also be found in Great Britain.
