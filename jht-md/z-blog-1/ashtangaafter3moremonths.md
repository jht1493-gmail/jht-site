### Ashtanga after 3 more months

Recording of my Ashtanga primary series practice after 3 months, approximately 90 days, about 29 sessions since last recording: [John Henry Thompson Ashtanga 2011-03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6M3EDv51Tk)

Recorded on iPhone. Better quality than last time, but recording limited to under 48 minutes, or 3.7Gig. 

Took 4 hours to upload to YouTube. 

Amazingly YouTube identified the Krishna Das playing in the background and displayed a link that says:

Buy "Kashi Vishwanath Gange" on: iTunes, AmazonMP3, eMusic

  

My last practice session, from Dec 31, 2010, after starting regular Ashtanga practice in Oct 2010:
