[My practice of Ashtanga Primary Series after one year](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JmGc0qyk78). Practice number 130.  
Recorded on low res camera of iPhone about 5pm at my local gym.  
  
I was fortunate in my twelfth month to take a 5-day mysore style workshop with [Jill Manning](http://www.jillmanning.com/). Up at 6:30am and practice the sequence at my own pace with guidance from Jill. There were 9 others in the workshop, including the director of Yoga Garden, Mark Nelson. The workshop opened me up to the possibility of an early morning practice. Jill said it was the one "obstacle" to regular practice that removed all the other obstacles. I'm beginning to see what she means. By getting the practice out of the way I don't have to struggle to fit into or around my work schedule or my eating schedule. I have a solid block of time everyday that I can devote to the practice. The key for me was to go to bed time two hours earlier.  Subtract two hours at night, but gain two hours the next day.  
  
In the workshop Jill helped me with a couple of things. She corrected my dristi during Sirsasana. I was looking the at edge of my mat, she correct me to look at my nose. The first time I tried I almost fell down, but now I think my head stand it more vertical - it was at an angle. She help me get achieve a full bind in Marichyasana D, which I haven't been able to fully repeat yet, but my entrance into Marichyasana D has improved. She also corrected my Parivitta Parsvakonasana, Ardha Baddha Padmottanasana, Supta Kurmasana, and Supta Padangusthasana. Thank you Jill.
