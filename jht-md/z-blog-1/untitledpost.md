Patanjali 1.1: The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff (CHITTA) is Yoga.  
  
Patanjali 2.29: The eight limbs of Yoga are:  
1) yama (abstinences)  
2) niyama (observances)  
3) asana (posture)  
4) pranayama (breath control)  
5) pratyahara (sense withdrawal)  
6) dharana (concentration)  
7) dhyana (meditation)  
8) samadhi (contemplation, absorption or superconscious state)  
  
Patanjali 2.30: Yama consists of  
non-violence,  
truthfulness,  
non-stealing,  
continence,  
and non-greed  
  
Patanjali 2.32: Niyama consists of  
purity,  
contentment,  
accepting but not causing pain (TAPAH),  
study of spiritual books (SVADHYAYA)  
and worship of God \[self-surrender\] (ISVARAPRANIDHANANI).
