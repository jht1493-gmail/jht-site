John Henry Thompson

Have you ever wondered how snapchat filters work? Or those Photo Booth effects? Photo manipulation is a huge part of our 21st century culture. And coding literacy is a core skill at this point. Don’t take for granted how simple it is to click a button to make a photo black & white or pixelated or colorized. In this workshop you will learn the basic mechanics behind photo editing in a “do it yourself” approach. 

**John Henry Thompson**’s coding language is the predecessor of Flash & JavaScript. Learn from the originator of photo filters. It is an exciting and accessible way to learn “do it yourself” photo editing.
