### The Outlier

I was ask recently if i was an outlier, in the statistical sense:  
 "a data point on a graph or in a set of results that is very much bigger or smaller than the next nearest data point."  
  
In an immediate sense i am an outlier. There are many things in my life experience that only i can claim credit for. But that does that does not mean i can't contribute to the uplifting of the general population. In a sense every individual is an outlier. You are unique, just like everybody else.
