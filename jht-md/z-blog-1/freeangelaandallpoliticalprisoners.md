### Free Angela and All Political Prisoners

posted Nov 28, 2013, 9:12 AM by John Henry Thompson

A very interesting documentary.  
Too bad it was only show for one evening.  
"Free Angela and All Political Prisoners is a gripping historic account of the events that catapulted a young University of California philosophy professor into a controversial political icon in the turbulent late 1960s."
