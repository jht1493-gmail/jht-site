Second morning getting up at 5am for 6:30 am Ashtanga Mysore workshop with [Jill Manning](http://www.jillmanning.com/).  
Able to put in required hours of  regular work after practice.  
Not as hard as I thought it would be to integrate early morning practice.  
I go to bed earlier (10pm) and have more energy during the day.  
Maybe it can be come a regular method of practice.
