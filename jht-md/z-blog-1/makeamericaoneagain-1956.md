Make America One Again - What happened in 1956?  
Let's return to the original USA motto: Out of many ONE!

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_one-dollar\_bill…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill#History)

"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" spans the top of the bill, "ONE DOLLAR" is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central "ONE" are the words "IN GOD WE TRUST," which became the official motto of the United States in 1956. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words "THE GREAT SEAL," and below the obverse on the right side are the words "OF THE UNITED STATES."

The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading "E PLURIBUS UNUM," a Latin phrase meaning "Out of many \[states\], one \[nation\]," a de facto motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956).
