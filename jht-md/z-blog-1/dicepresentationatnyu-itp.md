What a fabulous collaboration with the inimitable, computer scientist, engineer and inventor John Henry Thompson at New York University's ITP Program at Tisch School of the Arts. SO exciting to learn about JT's newest invention - DICE:- an open source platform under development to enable the creation of interactive art. DICE will unlock the power of your devices and enable them to communicate with each other in ways limited only by your imagination. Come join the revolution! Collaborators wanted.
