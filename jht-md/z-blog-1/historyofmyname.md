*   My family and cousins call me "Johnnie"
*   In 6th grade, immigrating from England to Brooklyn USA, I briefly had the nick name "England."
*   My mother sometimes called me "John the baptist." She would often say "Since Johnnie was a boy...", referring to some thing from the past.  
    
*   In college at MIT, the computer log in names where restricted to 8 characters or less and I used the login name "JHT."
*   I was given the capoeria name "Batista" studying with Marcelo Pereira in Oakland CA in late 1980's.
*   When I started my career developing software at Macromind (later Macromedia and then absorbed by Adobe), I was known as "JT."
*   In the late 1990's I decided to dropped "JT" (all members of my family share these initials) and include my middle name and started using my full name: "John Henry Thompson." My father named me after his father.
*   Today I sign my email -JHT
