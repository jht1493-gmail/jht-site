### Fragile Digital Memory

The digital media is so fragile.

  

I started [metadeepmix](http://metadeepmix.com/a2/) project in 2014's based on [Parse backend](https://parse.com/), which will be retired in Jan 2017. Hopefully Parse will live on as open source at [parse-server on github](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server). I would need to convert metadeepmix from Parse backend to Parse server. More work, with little benefit. Maybe time better spent converting to open source SOLR based backed and get full text search.

  

Thinking about update to [webdb site](http://metadeepmix.com/webdb/webdb/) (about [W.E.B Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois) 1900 [Paris photo exhibit](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/) on progress of African American since emancipation). The site started of as a page in metadeepmix site and I extracted it so that it did not depend on the Parse backend, only html and json.

  

Considering adding reference to [thehistorymakers.com](http://www.thehistorymakers.com/) as a contemporary record of African American's in American.

  

Should document of metadeepix before Parse backend dies (screen shots, screen video recording).

  

Considering documenting development of metadeepmix as a computer science learning story.
