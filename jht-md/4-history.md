## Macromind Inc.

[MacroMind became Macromedia and then was acquired by Adobe in 2005.](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/19/technology/adobe-buys-macromedia-for-34-billion.html)

What New York Times said about the 2005 acquisition:

**"Macromedia, based in San Francisco, **

**had a profit of \$41.5 million in 2004, **

**on revenue of \$370 million. **

**The company has about 1,200 workers, **

**while Adobe, with annual sales of more than \$1.7 billion, **

**employs about 3,700."**

MacroMind was founded by **Marc Canter** and his then wife

**Devorah Canter** in Chicago in the 1980's.

They moved the company to the SF Bay area in 1989

with the first round of venture funding.

The Chatter Box interpreter in prior art letter was the conceptual basis

for the **Lingo** programming language that I implemented

for the Adobe/Macromedia Director, a application for multimedia authoring.

**Lingo** started out as a dialect of **BASIC**,

evolved to a dialect of **HyperTalk** and **Smalltalk**,

and ended as a dialect of **JavaScript**.

Along the way I wrote a **Lingo** to convertor from**Java**

(with type inference) around 1997.

I added **JavaScript** as an alternative scripting option

to **Adobe Director** in 2003.

## Prior art

When I became a full time employee of **MacroMind** in **1989**

I had to list all my prior inventions since from then on any

new inventions were to be property of the company,

thus the need for this letter.

I think the legal term is prior art.
