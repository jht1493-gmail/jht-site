### The Baby and the Boat

A Story my father told.  
  
**The Baby and The Boat**  
  
My dad said he roomed with the Dookie family and would shave granddad Dookie regularly. Every time my father shaved granddad Dookie, my dad said, granddad Dookie would tell the same story: He and his young wife were taken to Jamaica on a very crowded boat (most likely a ship). On the boat was a another young couple and the wife was pregnant. While at sea, she gave birth on the boat. The boat was so crowded passengers had to transfer to another less crowded boat. While crossing over to the new boat the new born baby was passed from one person to the next. Someone let the baby slip and the baby fell into the sea. Granddad Dookie always ended the story by saying: "The baby born at sea, the baby died at sea."

  

Granddad Dookie told the same story every time Walter shaved him.

  

 "The baby born at sea, the baby died at sea."
