At a time like this, scorching irony, 

not convincing argument, is needed. 

O! had I the ability, 

and could I reach the nation’s ear, 

I would, to-day, 

pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, 

blasting reproach, 

withering sarcasm, 

and stern rebuke. 

For it is not light that is needed, but fire; 

it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. 

We need the storm, 

the whirlwind, 

and the earthquake. 

The feeling of the nation must be quickened; 

the conscience of the nation must be roused; 

the propriety of the nation must be startled; 

the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; 

and its crimes against God 

and man must be proclaimed and denounced.

Have you ever wondered how snapchat filters work? Or those Photo Booth effects? Photo manipulation is a huge part of our 21st century culture. And coding literacy is a core skill at this point. Don’t take for granted how simple it is to click a button to make a photo black & white or pixelated or colorized. In this workshop you will learn the basic mechanics behind photo editing in a “do it yourself” approach. 

**John Henry Thompson**’s coding language is the predecessor of Flash & JavaScript. Learn from the originator of photo filters. It is an exciting and accessible way to learn “do it yourself” photo editing.

What a fabulous collaboration with the inimitable, computer scientist, engineer and inventor John Henry Thompson at New York University's ITP Program at Tisch School of the Arts. SO exciting to learn about JT's newest invention - DICE:- an open source platform under development to enable the creation of interactive art. DICE will unlock the power of your devices and enable them to communicate with each other in ways limited only by your imagination. Come join the revolution! Collaborators wanted. 

Contact JHT at [github.com/jht1493.](https://github.com/jht1493.)  
Coincidentally, JT was the keynote speaker at a conference which I along with[Marilyn Nance](https://www.facebook.com/sistanance?fref=mentions),[Bathsheba Okwenje](https://www.facebook.com/bathsheba.okwenje?fref=mentions),[Sandra Aluoch Simbiri](https://www.facebook.com/atieno.aluochsimbiri?fref=mentions), Omowale Morgan,[Afua Brown](https://www.facebook.com/afuabrown?fref=mentions), Leticia and many others organized and hosted as students at ITP in 1999!!!
